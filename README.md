# AMQ-Scripts

## AMQ Extra Emotes
Adds emote shortcodes currently missing from the dropdown.
Based off of the [JoyPixels](https://github.com/joypixels/emoji-toolkit) library. This script was pretty hastily thrown together so expect problems, but please do report them to me if you encounter anything.
Example: ![handshake emoji - the game is saved](https://github.com/mintydudeosu/AMQ-Scripts/assets/139930764/b8f5f2f9-a768-4c40-a537-080f69908d2c)


More to come when I stop being too lazy to migrate everything to GitHub
