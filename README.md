## AMQ Extra Emotes
Adds emote shortcodes currently missing from the dropdown.
Based off of the [JoyPixels](https://github.com/joypixels/emoji-toolkit) library. This script was pretty hastily thrown together so expect problems, but please do report them to me if you encounter anything.
Example: ![handshake emoji - the game is saved](https://github.com/mintydudeosu/AMQ-Scripts/assets/139930764/b8f5f2f9-a768-4c40-a537-080f69908d2c)

## AMQ Styling
Made to style AMQ to fit my own preferences - there's a lot that still needs to be done, but the main things have been taken care of.

This script also contains a couple of settings editable in the **Graphics** tab of AMQ's own settings window. I'd recommend either turning off the **Blur Backgrounds** option or enabling **Hardware Acceleration** on your browser if you're experiencing extreme lag.

It's also worth noting I play on 125% zoom so the screenshots will look slightly bigger than what you'd actually see.
